-----------------------

Revert Listbuffer command back to CTRL-x CTRL-b.

December 2, 2013 : emg 1.2
--------------------------
Alternate keybindings for RetroBSD users using flow control terminal emulators.
Alternate keybindings for tmux users who are using the default control command.

October 24, 2013 : emg 1.1
--------------------------
Listbuffer command is now CTRL-x l (originally CTRL-x CTRL-b).
	This is because the default command keybinding of tmux is CTRL-b.
Search is now executed with <ENTER> instead of <ESC>.
	<ESC> felt awkward, plus I don't search for newlines.
Lots of code cleanups (ttyio.c).
	Removal of unused #if blocks.
	Use panic() everywhere.
	Fix all warnings from gcc -Wall.

October 19, 2013 : emg 1.0
--------------------------
Initial version of emg. Current targets are OpenBSD and RetroBSD.
