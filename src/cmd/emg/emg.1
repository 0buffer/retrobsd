.Sh NAME
.Nm emg
.Nd very small Emacs-like text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm emg
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ,
or Ersatz Mg, is an Emacs-like text editor designed for RetroBSD
and other memory-constrained environments.
.Nm
was originally created to fit into an operating environment of 96K of RAM,
and one in which Mg did not fit and Ersatz Emacs did not build.
By combining parts of each a working editor was created.
.Pp
When invoked without file arguments,
.Nm
creates a
.Qq main
buffer.
This buffer must be renamed
.Ic ( C-x n )
in order to be saved
.Ic ( C-x C-s ) .
.Pp
As both Ersatz Emacs and Mg are Public Domain, 
.Nm
is also Public Domain.
.Sh FILES
There is a chart of key bindings in
.Pa /usr/local/share/doc/emg/emg.keys .
Consulting this file is a must.
While
.Nm
strives to maintain compatibility with larger Emacs implementations,
there may be features intentionally left unimplemented in order to keep
.Nm
as small as possible.
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
is a combination of Ersatz Emacs and Mg and therefore all authors
for both deserve credit.
Ersatz Emacs and Mg were combined by
.An Brian Callahan Aq Mt bcallah@openbsd.org
to create
.Nm .
.Sh BUGS
None known.
However, patches are appreciated if any are found.
.Sh TODO
It would be nice to have automatic window resizing.
It would also be nice if
.Nm
could clear the screen when quit, like Mg does.
