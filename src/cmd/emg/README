emg
===

emg, or Ersatz Mg, is a very tiny Emacs-like text editor created by
combining elements of Ersatz Emacs and Mg (both the mg1a release and the
current OpenBSD-maintained version).

The goal of this editor is to have something Emacs like for RetroBSD
(a release of 2.11BSD for PIC32 microcontrollers). After noticing that the
vi clone RetroBSD is using, VIrus, is GPL-licensed, I decided to provide
a better-licensed editor. I also decided that, as a vi user myself, it would
be easier to create an Emacs clone. Like you, I'm also unsure as to how that
conclusion was reached.

I had initially tried to port Mg to RetroBSD but it was simply too large.
Ersatz Emacs does not build on RetroBSD, as RetroBSD is missing some functions
that Ersatz Emacs requires. It made sense to try to take from each and create
an editor that would work.

In a way, emg has a double meaning: not only is it a combination of
the two programs that comprise it, it is also a substitute Mg after my initial
port failed.

I have cleaned up some code where necessary; emg builds without errors on
RetroBSD.

Patches are also very welcome. I ask that you keep in mind the resource
constraints of RetroBSD: everything must fit in 96K RAM. But of course,
smaller is better.

I've left Chris Baird's Ersatz Emacs README here so others can better
appreciate the history of this software.

As both Ersatz Emacs and Mg are Public Domain, emg is also Public Domain.

Versions of emg up to and including 1.2 also supported OpenBSD; OpenBSD
has since dropped the older headers, such as sgtty.h, and it is not worth
reimplementing these for OpenBSD since OpenBSD maintains Mg.
